### COMM318: _Stories from data_: Introduction to programming for data journalism

**Fall 2019: T/Th 12:00-1:30pm**  
**Room: 108 ASC**  



**Professor**: Dr. Matt O'Donnell
**Email**: mbod@asc.upenn.edu

## Course Description, Goals and Objectives

Today masses of data are available everywhere, capturing information on just
about everything and anything. Related but distinct data streams about
newsworthy events and issues -- including activity from social media and open
data sources (e.g OpenGov initiative) -- have given rise to a new source for and
style of reporting sometimes called Data Journalism. Increasingly, news sites
and information portals present visually engaging, dynamic, and interactive
stories linked to the underlying data (e.g. The Guardian DataBlog).  News
providers also create online repositories providing access to the numbers behind
the stories. This course will address two challenges to being able to
effectively catch the wave in this sea of data and create effective
communication. First, the course offers an introduction to Python programming
for data analysis and visualization. Students will learn how to collect,
analyze, and present various forms of data. Second, because numbers and their
visualizations alone do not speak for themselves but require context,
interpretation, and narrative, students will practice making effective stories
from data and presenting them in blog-like and other forms.


No prior programming experience is required. Through this course students will gain skills writing Python programs to handle large amounts of textual data and become familiar with one of the key techniques used by data scientists, which is currently one of the most in-demand jobs.

* This course will provide an introduction to Python programming for collecting, cleaning, describing and analyzing a range
of publicly available datasets, including demographic (e.g., age, race, education levels by geographic area),
medical (e.g. vacination, ER intakes for certain conditions like flu, measles, etc),
financial (e.g., spending on infrastructure, education, other initatives, income distribution, etc.), and
transportation (e.g., usage statistics for public transportation and private schemes, e.g. bike shares).

* Each week one session will be in lecture and seminar form and provide background for the theory and techniques and the second will be a lab session
in which students will work through programming exercises using Jupyter notebooks [A web-based programming environment well suited for data science and class-based assignments].

* By completing this course students will:
	* gain an understanding of how data can be used to support the reporting and making of news
	* explore the range of various kinds of data now available through initiatives such as Open Government Data initiative (data.gov) and a range of other available and curated data archives
	* be exposed to a range of techniques from data journalism, data science and information visualization and understand how they can be used to tell news/media stories
	* gain a basic level of programming proficiency in the Python programming language and have completed a number of programming exercises to collect, clean, analyze, visualize and interpret such data

## Assessment

~~
1. **Complete the assigned readings and participation in class discussion (10%)**
	* Readings for each week will be posted on Canvas when electronic versions are available or taken from one of the recommended textbooks.
2. **Attend weekly lab sessions and complete the assigned exercises (40%)**
    * Thursday class sessions will be programming labs. Students are required to bring a laptop that can connect to the ASC network. Please contact the me if this is difficult and we can see if a machine can be made available for use in lab.
	* We will be using Jupyter notebooks to learn Python, which are a web-based interactive programming environment. Assignments will be completed in this and submitted to the instructor. Details of using this system for assignments will be covered in the first lab session.
	* Weekly assignments will be due at 5pm on the Tuesday following lab session (see schedule for details). These assignments are intended to help students practice the programming concepts and structures introduced in lab and build confidence. They should not be difficult or take excessive time but they do build from week to week so it is _very_ important to keep up.
3. **Complete a project that uses the techniques and theory covered in class to carry out a data analysis of a specific research question agreed upon with the instructor (50%)**
    * The goal of this project is to create an engaging blog post similar those produced by data journalists after [State of the Union](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/01/21/the-state-of-the-union-address-in-a-single-figure/?utm_term=.1a2854849261) addresses or on a topic like ['How men and women talk about love'](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/07/upshot/modern-love-what-we-write-when-we-write-about-love.html) in the NYTimes recently.

    * The steps in the project are:
         1. Decide upon a tractable research question that involves analysis of textual data, e.g.:
            * _Did Hillary Clinton's language as candidate change between 2008 and 2016?_
            * _What makes and when is Donald Trump happy (as evidenced on Twitter)?_
            * _What characterises the online media's discussion of poverty/immigration/etc.?_
            * _From smoking to vaping - Examining online testimonials of e-cigarette users_
            * _Comparing portrayal of women in rap and country music__
         2. Identify, retrieve and prepare a relevant corpus, e.g.
            * Clinton 2008 and 2016 campaign speeches
            * Trumps tweets since 2014
            * Online news coverage of poverty/immigration/..
            * User stories from online vaping forum, etc.)
            * Representative samples of song lyrics
         3. Carry out linguistic analysis of corpus, e.g.
            * Construct comparative frequency lists of 2008 and 2016 speeches by Clinton, identify keywords, collocations and examined and interpret concordance listings
            * Apply approrpriate sentiment analysis techniques to Trump tweet corpus, cluster tweets by sentiment and time, examine distinctive words and phrases
            * Collocation analysis of topic related words (e.g. _poverty, poor, low-income_ or _immigration, immigrants, illegals, illegal aliens_)
            * Create n-gram frequency lists and compare collocations and patterns relating to _smoking_ and _vaping_
            * Examine and compare collocates of words for women between two genres
         4. Visualize data
            * Find appropriate ways to communicate the most important and relevant results from step 3. This might be use a frequency list, concordance listings, a scatter plot of words and phrases, etc.
         5. Interpret findings
            * How does your text analysis answer your research question?
            * Why and how does it matter?
         6. Write up in a blog post


            These steps will be scheduled throughout the course allowing for the instructor to help you find a manageable problem, acquire the necessary data and be able to carry out the appropriate computational analysis.

     * More details of the kinds of projects that would be appropriate and manageable will be discussed during the first few weeks of class.

## Note about learning programming

A central goal of this class is to help students begin to develop programming skills that they can use to approach questions of interest using the growing amounts of textual data available in the era of 'big data'. But like learning any new skill, such as a new language, it takes time and can be frustrating at first. This course does not require students to have any programming background. Realistically it is not possible to become a fully proficient programmer in just one semester. However, the lab sessions and assignments are focused on helping you begin this process and to become comfortable with reading, understanding and modifying Python code examples that you can find on the web etc.
