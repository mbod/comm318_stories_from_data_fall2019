## COMM318: _Stories from data_: Introduction to programming for data journalism

**Fall 2019 Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania**

## Course Description, Goals and Objectives

Today masses of data are available everywhere, capturing information on just
about everything and anything. Related but distinct data streams about
newsworthy events and issues -- including activity from social media and open
data sources (e.g OpenGov initiative) -- have given rise to a new source for and
style of reporting sometimes called Data Journalism. Increasingly, news sites
and information portals present visually engaging, dynamic, and interactive
stories linked to the underlying data (e.g. The Guardian DataBlog).  News
providers also create online repositories providing access to the numbers behind
the stories. This course will address two challenges to being able to
effectively catch the wave in this sea of data and create effective
communication. First, the course offers an introduction to Python programming
for data analysis and visualization. Students will learn how to collect,
analyze, and present various forms of data. Second, because numbers and their
visualizations alone do not speak for themselves but require context,
interpretation, and narrative, students will practice making effective stories
from data and presenting them in blog-like and other forms. 


No prior programming experience is required. Through this course students will gain skills writing Python programs to handle large amounts of textual data and become familiar with one of the key techniques used by data scientists, which is currently one of the most in-demand jobs.

* This course will provide an introduction to Python programming for collecting, cleaning, describing and analyzing a range
of publicly available datasets, including demographic (e.g., age, race, education levels by geographic area), 
medical (e.g. vacination, ER intakes for certain conditions like flu, measles, etc), 
financial (e.g., spending on infrastructure, education, other initatives, income distribution, etc.), and
transportation (e.g., usage statistics for public transportation and private schemes, e.g. bike shares).

* Each week one session will be in lecture and seminar form and provide background for the theory and techniques and the second will be a lab session
in which students will work through programming exercises using Jupyter notebooks [A web-based programming environment well suited for data science and class-based assignments].

* By completing this course students will:
	* gain an understanding of how data can be used to support the reporting and making of news 
	* explore the range of various kinds of data now available through initiatives such as Open Government Data initiative (data.gov) and a range of other available and curated data archives
	* be exposed to a range of techniques from data journalism, data science and information visualization and understand how they can be used to tell news/media stories
	* gain a basic level of programming proficiency in the Python programming language and have completed a number of programming exercises to collect, clean, analyze, visualize and interpret such data
